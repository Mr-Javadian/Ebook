    <h1>AVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN'S SHOES</h1>
    <b>
      <p>
        What happensfirst always appears better and more original than what
        comes after.If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will
        have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not
        get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making:
        Establish your own name and identity by changing course. Slay the
        overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in
        your own way.
