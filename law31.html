    <h1>CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DEAL</h1>
    <b>
      <p>
        The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a
        choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your
        puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one
        they choose.Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils,
        both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a dilemma:
        They are gored wherever they turn.
