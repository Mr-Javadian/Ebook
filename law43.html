      <p>
        Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You
        must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A person you
        have seduced becomes yourloyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to
        operate on theirindividual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the
        resistant by working on their emotions, playing on what they hold dear
        and what they fear.Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will
        grow to hate you.
